# Serverless Component Templates

These are templates that contain pre-made projects with Serverless Components.  They are excellent starting points for all types of use-cases.  We will keep adding to these over time.

Aside from installing dependencies, all you have to do to deploy these is run the `$ serverless` command with the [Serverless Framework](https://www.github.com/serverless/serverless).

Enjoy,
Serverless Inc.
